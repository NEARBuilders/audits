# NEAR Audit Database

# Audits

Public Audits in the NEAR Ecosystem. Make a PR to add additional ones, this is a work in progress, got lazy not even close to finishing.

To-do

- Finish finding all audits
- Backup all the audits on Arweave + IPFS and archive all instances of audit on wayback machine
- Work with ecosystem aggregator like NEAR Horizon to reference audits
- Compile all the exploits
- Format all sexy
- Let projects and NEAR Founders know to make a PR
- Contact all projects without audits and let them know they canâ€™t be lacking in these streets like that
- Publish this on BOS
- try to get funding for all these unaudited projects from NF or â€¦â€¦. lol

# ðŸ”‘Â Key

- âœ…Â audit public, doesnâ€™t mean no vulnerabilities, and doesn't mean audit has been checked or its been by firm listed below, just that it exists. This also doesnâ€™t mean that an audit was done for all smart contract and dApp functionality.
- ðŸ“¦Â audit may exist somewhere but private. Or publicly mentioned an audit but the audit isnt public.
- ðŸ‘€Â = looking for an audit make a PR
- ðŸŸ¡Â = getting an audit
- ðŸ˜¡Â = as of last talking to team no audit
